## Program output log files for ECE4960 - Project 4.
- The output simulation logs for RC and Amplifier circuits, with different ODE solvers, where the postfix "1ns" representing timestep = 1ns, and "02ns" representing timestep = 0.2ns. *Within each circuit simulation output file, the first column is V1 and second is V2.*
- The output ||error%|| logs of ODE solver's validation.
