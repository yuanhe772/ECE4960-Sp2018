**********Project #1 is constructed with 9 java classes******
   
    8 of them are the "functional classes", with specific implementations of each exercise mentioned in the handout. In each of the "functional classes", sub-functions are implemented as public methods(providing interface for Main class to demonstrate the outputs) and private methods(as helper functions for the other in-class methods). 
   
    The other one class is the main class, providing entry for the entire project, calling functions in other 8 classes to instantiate  exception handling behaviors stated by the handout. The main class also automatically generated two reports.
    
    
    
**********Only imported one package******
   
    Only imported "java.io.*" for the purpose of streaming out the auto-reports.



**********Tips on how to read the 1st and 2nd level reports******
   
    For the purpose of increasing the readability of the reports:
    Violated behaviors' ouptputs such as ArithmeticExceptions, concept errors(creating a incorrect +0 for instance), and overflows are marked with *** .
   
    The outputs of additional application (Pi with 30 digits) is marked with *.
