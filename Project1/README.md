********Project #1 is constructed with 9 java classes******
   8 of them are the "functional classes", with specific implementations of each exercise mentioned by the handout. In each of the "functional classes", sub-functions are implemented as public methods(providing interface for Main class to demonstrate the outputs) and private methods(as helper functions for the other in-class methods). 
    The other one class is the main class, providing entry for the entire project, calling functions in other 8 classes to instantiate certain exception behaviors stated by the handout. The main class also automatically creates two reports.
    
    
    
********Only importing one package******
    Only imported "java.io.*" for the purpose of streaming out the auto-reports.



********Tips on how to read the 1st and 2nd level reports******
    For the purpose of increasing the readability of the reports:
    Violated behaviors' ouptputs such as ArithmeticExceptions and overflows are marked with *** .
    The outputs of additional application is marked with *.
