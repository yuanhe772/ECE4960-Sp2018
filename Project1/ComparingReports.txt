I wrote the project on MacOS (64bits), using IDE of Eclipse - Java8. 
The project was also run on Windows (64bits), with command-line prompt terminal (javac, java to run the scripts).

After running on both of these two OSes with the exact same code, the reports generated respectively have the exact same result as well (it could have been that I imported only java.io*).
