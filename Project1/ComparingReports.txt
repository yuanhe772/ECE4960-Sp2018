I wrote the project on MacOS (64bits), using IDE of Eclipse - Java8. 
The project was also run on Windows (64bits), with command-line prompt terminal (javac, java to run the scripts).

After running on both of these two OSes with the exact same code, the reports generated respectively have the exact same results as well (It could have been that I imported only java.io* for this project, which is a very basic and common package for every JDK environment. Therefore the behavior between these two OSes doesn't deviate, and the poratablility is quite well in this case).
