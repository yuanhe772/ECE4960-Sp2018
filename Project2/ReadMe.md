# ECE4960 - Programming Assignment 2

#### 1. Overview:

This program is written in java, and compiled with both Eclipse on Mac OS and Command Line in Linux.

#### 2. Program Breakdown:

The program is broken into 5 classes, Main.java, Test.java, SparseMatrix.java, Vector.java, and Jacobi.java:

 - SparseMatrix.java: construct the sparse matrix's data structures into an instantiable class, and implemented the sparse matrix basic operations including addition(subtraction), matrix multiplication, element - retrieving, value-setting, and Jacobi-decomposition;
 
 - Vector. java: construct vector's data structures into an instantiable class, providing more flexibilty in development than simple Arrays when operated with sparse matrix. Also implemented basic vector operation of addition(subtraction).
 
 - Jacobi.java: implemented the iterative steps of Jacobi-Iterative solver.
 
 - Test.java: verify the
