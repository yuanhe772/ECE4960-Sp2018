The same Java program is run with Eclipse on MAC OS, and with Linux's command-line on Cornell ECE Linux server. 

Only one difference is observed when comparing results generated from these two platforms:

Assertion Enabling Configurations:
	Eclipse: 
	Enable assertions by modifying the Run Configurations -> VM Arguments -> Manually adding ¡°-ea¡±;
	Linux Command Line: 
	Before running programs, ¡°java -ea ProjectName¡± to enable assertions.
